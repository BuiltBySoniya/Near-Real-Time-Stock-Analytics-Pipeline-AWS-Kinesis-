# Near-Real-Time-Stock-Analytics-Pipeline-AWS-Kinesis-
Built a near real-time stock analytics pipeline using Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Athena, and SNS. The system ingests tick data, computes metrics/anomalies, stores raw + processed datasets, enables SQL analytics on S3, and sends trend alertsâ€”low-ops and cost-efficient.
